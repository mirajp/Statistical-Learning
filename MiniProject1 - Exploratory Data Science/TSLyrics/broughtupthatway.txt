Emily comes home from school,
Grabs onto her daddy's hand,
He says, &quot;Baby girl, what's wrong with you?&quot;
She says, &quot;Please, don't make me go back there again.&quot;
She said, &quot;I wish there was some way
To make them stop it.&quot;
So he drives down to
That principles office and says,
&quot;I didn't bring her up
So they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here
So they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way.&quot;
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time,
She doesn't have too much to say
She said, &quot;He tried but there's just some things I won't do.&quot;
And through the tears she said, &quot;I couldn't do that to you.&quot;
And he said,
&quot;I didn't bring you up
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart
And turn it inside out.
I live my whole damn life
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way.&quot;
The phone rings on a rainy night
Says, &quot;It's officer Tate.&quot;
He said, &quot;Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily â€“ she's fading fast.&quot;
He says, &quot;God, I didn't bring her up
To watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day
They put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
She wasn't brought up that way.&quot;
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes
