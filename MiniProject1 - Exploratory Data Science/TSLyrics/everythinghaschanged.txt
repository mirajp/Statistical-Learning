All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
<i>[Taylor Swift]</i>
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
<i>[Both]</i>
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
<i>[Both]</i>
'Cause all I know is we said, &quot;Hello.&quot;
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
<i>[Ed Sheeran]</i>
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you
<i>[Taylor Swift (Album version) / Ed Sheeran (Remix version):]</i>
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time,
<i>[Album version:]</i> Taking flight, making me feel right
<i>[Remix version:]</i> Taking flight, making me feel right like
<i>[Both]</i>
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
<i>[Both]</i>
'Cause all I know is we said, &quot;Hello.&quot;
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
<i>[Bridge]</i>
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind.
<i>[Taylor Swift]</i>
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
<i>[Both]</i>
All I know is we said, &quot;Hello.&quot;
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
<i>[Taylor Swift]</i>
All I know is we said, &quot;Hello.&quot;
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
