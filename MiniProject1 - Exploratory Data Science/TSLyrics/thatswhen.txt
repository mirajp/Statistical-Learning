I said I know
He said need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
I watched him go
He watched me crushed to the floor
On my knees, just like that
He said, &quot;When can I come back?&quot;
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when
I said I know,
He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this
'Cause I let you go, you let me think
That I'll be fine without you
Imagine that!
So baby I'll come back
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I'll never see your face
I let you in, baby that's when
And I said all this playing
Did you ever think of me?
And he said
That's when I woke up in the morning
That's when after sun is always storming
Laughing when I was crying!
And that's when we will waiting up to f*ckin'
That's when I saw your face
To let me in, baby that's when
I said I know
He said I need some time, need some space
